# Musca_Gut_MGs
The housefly (Musca domestica) is a fly of the suborder Cyclorrhapha. It possibly originated in the Middle East, and spread around the world as a commensal of humans. It is the most common fly species found in houses. Here we investigate the gut microbiome of the house fly and how it helps for niche adaptation and food utilisation.
